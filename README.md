# Toronto_Vehicle_Collision_Analysis
## Table of Contents
## Overview 
This project deep dives into motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) in Toronto using historical data from 2014 to the present (2023).
* Built an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize key insights on accident hotspots, contributing factors, and trends.
* The goal is to provide actionable insights to Toronto Police Service which includes policy makers, law enforcement, and city planners to enhance road safety.
* This project support the city of toronto Vision Zero Road safety Plan

## Background & Problem Statement 
Motor vehicle collisions are a major concern in urban areas, affecting public safety, infrastructure, and city planning. In Toronto, the city has committed to the **Vision Zero Road Safety Plan**, a comprehensive initiative aimed at reducing traffic-related fatalities and serious injuries on its streets. This project will contribute to the goals of Vision Zero by providing a data-driven, targeted approach for Toronto Police and city planners, enabling them to focus on the locations and factors where road safety improvements are most needed.

In Toronto:

* 35,000 - 40,000 MVCs occur annually, ranging from minor property damage to fatalities.
* High-risk locations, times, and factors contributing to accidents remain unclear without deep data analysis.

By analyzing historical trends and key collision factors, this project seeks to provide actionable insights to improve road safety policies, urban planning, and traffic management.

## Aim
The primary objective of this project is to identify trends and patterns in MVCs to support data-driven decision-making for safer roads.
Specifically, this project aims to:

Identify high-risk areas for targeted safety interventions.
Analyze how external factors (e.g., COVID-19, weather) impact collision rates.
Determine the time-of-day trends to guide law enforcement in deploying resources efficiently.
Assess the impact of driver behaviors (e.g., fail-to-remain incidents).
Help lawmakers and city officials take proactive measures to reduce road accidents.
